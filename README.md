# CorrelationGuessr

A small game where the user guesses the correlation of two different measures in a bar plot (e.g., color and bar height, or opacity and bar width). I am hosting it at [https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessr.html](https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessr.html).

The game is implemented with React and Material UI. It was a little project to learn React.
