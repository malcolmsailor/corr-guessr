# CorrelationGuessr

A small game where the user guesses the correlation of two different features in a bar plot (e.g., color and bar height, or opacity and bar width).

I have made two versions of the game:

- in the first version, you can set the features to be correlated manually and type in your guess of the exact correlation. I am hosting it at [https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessr.html](https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessr.html).
- in the second version, you are under time pressure and have to simply guess whether each correlation is "high" or "low." You progress through a series of "levels" consisting of different sets of features and as you advance, the difference between "high" and "low" correlations gets smaller. I am hosting this version at [https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessrGame.html](https://malcolmsailor.com/static_pages/corrGuessrGame.html).

The game is implemented with React and Material UI. It was a little project to learn React.
